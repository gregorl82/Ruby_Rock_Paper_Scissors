<h1>Ruby Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
<p>Create a simple sinatra app to allow the user to play rock, paper, scissors in their browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be able to go to /rock/scissors and return the string “rock wins” to the page, for example.</li>
<li>You will need to write a bit of logic that compares the two hands and decides which one has won, and then use that in the route definition.</li>
<li>Next, create a models directory for your game logic class e.g. ‘Game’ and put all of the logic in there - there shouldn’t be any logic left in the controller!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an ERB view file for returning the result of the game, rather than just sending a string.</li>
<li>Add a welcome page (and a route to get it) to explain the rules before the user picks their move. Add a link to this on the result view.</li>
<li>Add some CSS to either/both of your pages.</li>
</ul>
